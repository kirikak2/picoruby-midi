/*
 * PicoRuby MIDI - Routing (MIDI Thru between transports)
 *
 * A route forwards what arrives on one transport straight to others, in C,
 * as the input task reads it -- no Ruby in the path, so a keyboard on the
 * USB host port can play a synth with the latency of the input task rather
 * than that of a script's polling loop.
 *
 * Transports are named by their bit in the transport registry (see
 * midi_transport.h). Packets are USB-MIDI packets (CIN + 3 bytes), and
 * forwarding goes through MIDI_transport_send().
 *
 * Sources are the transports the input task reads (USB host, UART, USB
 * device -- the last only while a route starts from it) plus
 * any transport that declares itself one with MIDI_route_set_source() and
 * pushes its own packets through MIDI_route_targets() -- e.g. an on-screen
 * keyboard, which produces MIDI on the UI task rather than receiving it.
 *
 * OS-free. The table is small and fixed; writers (Ruby, via the bindings)
 * and the reader (the input task) are not locked against each other, so a
 * packet that races a change may go by the old or the new table.
