# MIDI routing (MIDI Thru)
#
# Forward what arrives on one transport straight to others. The forwarding
# happens in C, in the input task, as each message is read -- no Ruby in the
# path -- so a keyboard on the USB host port can play a synth with no more
# delay than the input task's poll (one RTOS tick, 10 ms at 100 Hz),
# whatever the script is doing.
#
#   MIDI.route(MIDIDevices.usb_midi_host, MIDIDevices.amy)              # everything
#   MIDI.route(MIDIDevices.usb_midi_host, MIDIDevices.sam2695, channel: 9)
#   MIDI.unroute(MIDIDevices.usb_midi_host, MIDIDevices.amy)
#   MIDI.unroute_all
#
# Sources are the transports the input task reads -- the USB-MIDI host, the
# UART (SAM2695 / UART_MIDI) and the USB-MIDI device (what the PC sends) --
# plus transports that declare themselves a
# source and forward their own output in C (e.g. picoruby-ui's UI::Keys, an
# on-screen keyboard). Any registered transport can be a destination.
# A MIDI::Input on the same source keeps working alongside: it receives the
# same messages, routed or not.
#
# MIDI.route returns a MIDI::Route, which can take a Ruby filter
# (MIDI.filter, midi_filter.rb):
#
#   MIDI.route(kb, syn).filter(types: [:note_on, :note_off]) { |m| m.note += 12; m }
