# MIDI Clock
#
# The master clock: one per process, run in C by the platform port (an
# esp_timer on ESP32). It is a MIDI device that only sends -- route it to
# where the clock should go:
#
#   MIDI.route(MIDI::Clock, dev)   # Timing Clock (F8), 24 per quarter note
#   MIDI::Clock.bpm = 128
#   MIDI::Clock.start              # Start (FA) along the routes; .stop / .continue
#
# The F8s run whenever something is routed from the clock, started or not
# (receivers follow the tempo while stopped); Start / Stop are messages of
# their own. What the script does in between does not move the clock, so
# any loop works with it: MIDI.start!, MIDI.bpm_loop, `loop do`, ...
#
# Without a port (no C clock) the class methods keep the tempo only, and
# MIDI.start! / MIDI.bpm_loop send the clock from their own Ruby loop.
#
# MIDI::Clock.new(device) is the older interface: a handle on the same clock
# that routes it to `device` between start and stop.
